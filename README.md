# Routing-System-

// The requirements for this routing system included storing data in a data structure that allows for insertions and seraching of data, calculating the distance between package addresses using the information provided in the CSV files and finding the best route to deliver the packages while staying under 140 miles total. The program contains a basic user interface that allows the user to enter a time and retrieve updated package data with multiple data points. The total mileage of all trucks is displayed while following the stipulations. The program is written using Python. 
// The nearest neighbor algorithm and a chaining hash table are used to deteremine the most efficient way to deliver the packages within the mileage constraints and store all needed data.
